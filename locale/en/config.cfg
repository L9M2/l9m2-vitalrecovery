This mainly is manufactured in an [entity=assembling-machine-1] or, if you are desperate, by hand for healthkits.\nThough once you have unlocked a higher grade [entity=assembling-machine-2] as it is recommended to produce it there since it is more efficient and less costly than by hand.\nIf you know what you are doing this could potentially be used to more effectively produce the important Vitaliqueur Fluid.
vitaliqueur-raw-fish=An odd quirk of putting a ton of fish into the fluid directly without steam causes an extra fish to come out of the fluid once drained. You theorized it is due to the time it takes for them to marinate and excess scales flaking off, but you are not too sure. Regardless, more fish!

intro-vitalrecovery=Welcome to Vital Recovery!\nIt will explain the mod and what it offers in visual form.\nTired of not having enough [item=raw-fish]Fish to heal up?\nMaybe you want some better healing options?\nThis is for you! \nNow you can create [item=small-healthkit][item=medium-healthkit][item=big-healthkit]\nHealthkits to top up for when the going gets rough!
vitalrecovery-healthkits-pure-impure=[item=small-healthkit][item=medium-healthkit][item=big-healthkit]\n[font=default-bold]Healthkits[/font] come in two varieties. Impure and Pure. Impure healthkits are made near the start of the game and they do not require much to create, however they are not as effective with their healing properties and cannot be used as quickly.\nPure healthkits are a more expensive form that require more work to obtain both in cost and research, but are faster at their use and can provide more health than the impure version.\nHigher tiers of healthkits require more resources.
vitalrecovery-solid-vitaliqueur=[item=solid-vitaliqueur]\nThe main ingredient in Vital Recovery for producing your basic healthkits is [font=default-bold]Solid Vitaliqueur[/font]. This mainly is manufactured in an [entity=assembling-machine-1] or if you are desperate by hand for healthkits.\nThough once you have unlocked a higher grade [entity=assembling-machine-2] as it is recommended to produce it there since it is more efficient and less costly than by hand.\nIf you know what you are doing this could potentially be used to more effectively produce the important Vitaliqueur Fluid.
vitalrecovery-vitaliqueur=[fluid=vitaliqueur]\nVitaliqueur Fluid is the main fluid to create higher end healthkits. You can either produce it directly from [item=raw-fish], or through the longer lengthier process of [item=solid-vitaliqueur].
vitalrecovery-fish-replication=[item=raw-fish]\nUsing [fluid=vitaliqueur] one can produce an endless amount of fish in a way that produces a surplus. Though while you can get fish this way, the process is slow and lengthy before it starts to snowball effectively.
vitalrecovery-modsettings=[fluid=vitaliqueur]\nYou will find the option to remove the Medical Science Pack in the mod settings.\nDoing so will completely remove it from the game and all the research and technologies will be changed accordingly.\nBy default it is [font=default-bold]True[/font].\nThis option can be done at any time!
